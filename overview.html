The MIT Java Wordnet Interface (JWI) is a Java library for interfacing with the Wordnet electronic 
dictionary.  It features API calls to retrieve index entries, synsets, morphological 
exceptions, and sense index entries from the Wordnet data files.  It also has 
calls that allow browsing by following lexical and semantic pointers, and 
contains classes that can perform simple morphological processing.  The library 
includes no GUI elements.
<p>
JWI is compatible with Wordnet versions 1.6 through 3.0, as well as a few other Wordnet variations.  
It is not compatible with Wordnet 1.5.  JWI does not include the Wordnet dictionary itself: that must be downloaded separately from the Wordnet site at 
<a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu">http://wordnet.princeton.edu</a>.
<p>
JWI is freely available, and licensed for use for all 
purposes, as long as proper acknowledgment is made.  Details can be found 
in the license, which is included in the distribution.
<p>
The entry point for accessing dictionary data is the 
{@link edu.mit.jwi.IDictionary} interface.  In the simplest case, where you are using Wordnet 
with the data files on the same filesystem as your Java program, you can 
instantiate a {@link edu.mit.jwi.Dictionary} object with a single argument, a {@code URL} or {@code File} object 
that points to the directory where the Wordnet dictionary data files are 
located.
<p>
An example of this can be found below, in the form of a Java method 
{@code runExample()}. In the method, the first block of seven lines (4-9) deals 
with constructing a {@code URL} object that points to the Wordnet data files.  
In this particular example, the base Wordnet directory is assumed to be stored 
in a system environment variable called WNHOME; this may be different on your 
system.  Note that the WNHOME variable points to the root of the Wordnet 
installation directory and the dictionary data directory “dict” must be 
appended to this path.  Again, this may be different on your system depending 
on where your Wordnet files are located.  The second block of code, two lines 
long (12-13), constructs an instance of the default Dictionary object, and 
opens it by calling the {@code open()} method.  The final block of six lines 
(16-21) demonstrates searching the dictionary for the first sense of the noun 
“dog”. The final numbered block of code shows the console output of the method.
<p>
Sample Dictionary code:
<pre>
1  public void runExample(){
2    
3     // construct the URL to the Wordnet dictionary directory
4     String wnhome = System.getenv("WNHOME");
5     String path = wnhome + File.separator + "dict";
6     URL url = null;
7     try{ url = new URL("file", null, path); } 
8     catch(MalformedURLException e){ e.printStackTrace(); }
9     if(url == null) return;
10    
11    // construct the dictionary object and open it
12    IDictionary dict = new Dictionary(url);
13    dict.open();
14
15    // look up first sense of the word "dog"
16    IIndexWord idxWord = dict.getIndexWord("dog", POS.NOUN);
17    IWordID wordID = idxWord.getWordIDs().get(0);
18    IWord word = dict.getWord(wordID);
19    System.out.println("Id = " + wordID);
20    System.out.println("Lemma = " + word.getLemma());
21    System.out.println("Gloss = " + word.getSynset().getGloss());
22
23  }
</pre>

Output (for Wordnet 3.0)
<pre>
1  Id = WID-2084071-n-?-dog
2  Lemma = dog
3  Gloss = a member of the genus Canis (probably descended from the common wolf) ...
</pre>
